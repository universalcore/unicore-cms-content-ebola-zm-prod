The illness affects humans\r\nand nonhuman primates (monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees). The illness can\r\nspread to other countries if they do not take precautions to prevent it.\r\nZambia has currently put up several measures to prevent the illness from\r\ncoming into the country. These measures require your cooperation.\r\n\r\n",
